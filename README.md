# FullStacko

A demonstration of a React front-end working with a .NET
back-end.

## Assumptions

The .NET code acts like a REST API proxy of sorts.
The API in the .NET back-end should attempt redundant paths
to ensure best effort service delivery.

The front-end should assume the user is impatient and needs
it to try its best to work with the back-end.
